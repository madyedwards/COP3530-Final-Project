# COP3530-Final-Project
reading in a set of recipes and sorting them based off user filters (ex. "show me all vegan recipes")
this will be filled out again once the project is complete; for now, can use it to make notes on what to do
- sorting algos 1 and 2
- frontend development
- fix/add formatted and full csv dataset
- include a function to calculate the time it takes to process the data (for the final report)
- finish the cleaned giant dataset for parsing our 200k datapoints
