# COP3530-Final-Project
4-25-2023: Our project, deemed "Food For Thought", is a program that inputs 200,000+ different recipes from a public dataset that contains a name, ingredients, duration, steps, and taglines associated with each recipe. These recipes are fed into our chosen data structure, an unordered map. The program then prompts the user to select from a given list of 15 different taglines, such as "vegan", "Mexican", or "60 minutes or less", to allow the user to filter through the recipes. They are also given the option to further filter through the recipes based on duration, number of steps, or ingredients used. Once these inputs have been given, the program will sort through the portions of the data structure that include recipes that fit within these specifications. Two sorting algorithms are utilized; merge sort and quick sort. Both are applied to the set of recipes, and whichever one has faster computation is the one whose output is printed for the user to see.
